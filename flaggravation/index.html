				<h3>about</h3>
				<p>This is a vexillological drafting card game with a score-keeping web app.<br><br>Players collect components common to flags from all around the world - like colors, structures, and objects often featured on flags - and use these to claim flags shown on screen.</p>
				<h3>cards</h3>
				<p>To download and print the cards, visit <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OaxCVDs_NqL-5FiIuIbnxm7rjchocYE-" target="_blank">Flaggravation</a> on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dreamhatchergames" target="_blank">DreamHatcher Games</a>.</p>
				<h3>rules</h3>
				<p>
					<h4>setup</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Open the Flaggravation web app on a phone or tablet.
							<ul>
								<li>Enter the names of all players.</li>
								<li>Set a Flag Goal. For first-time players, the recommended goal is 5.</li>
								<li>Click "Continue". Place the device in a central spot close to all players.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Spread out all the component cards, face-down, in a messy Pool on the table.</li>
						<li>Each player selects a Hand of 4 random cards from the Pool.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>turn order</h4>
					<p>Play is simultaneous each round.</p>
					<h4>gameplay</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>All players pick up 1 random card from the Pool to add to their Hand, for 5 total cards.</li>
						<li>All players select 1 card from their Hand to place face-up in front of them in a Personal Pile. At any time, you may reorganize your Personal Pile.</li>
						<li>Once all players have made a selection, all players pass the remaining 4 cards in their Hand to the left (clockwise).</li>
						<li>Play continues in this way throughout the game.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>special rules</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>At any point, if, in your Personal Pile in front of you, you have the components required for a Flag shown on the app, say the name of the Flag aloud.
							<ul>
								<li>Some cards are "Wild" and represent any 1 of a set of components. (Ex: Colors substitutes for a Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Black, or White.)</li>
								<li>If 2 players have a claim (see below), it's whoever says the Flag name first.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Reveal these component cards to show they match the Flag's requirements.
							<ul>
								<li>If they do not, place these cards back in your Personal Pile.</li>
								<li>If they do meet the requirements:
									<ol>
										<li>Place these component cards in a face-up Discard Deck to the side.</li>
										<li>The app shows the number of cards to collect next to the flag. Add this quantity of random Pool cards to your Personal Pile.</li>
										<li>Select the applicable Flag, and then your name, to increase your score.</li>
										<li>Switch the direction of passing (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) until the next Flag is claimed.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>When the Pool is exhausted, shuffle the Discard Deck and create a new Pool.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>end</h4>
					<p>The game ends when someone has claimed the Goal number of Flags; this player wins.</p>
