				<h3>about</h3>
				<p>This is a vexillological drafting card game with a score-keeping web app.<br><br>Players collect components common to flags from all around the world - like colors, structures, and objects often featured on flags - and use these to claim flags shown on screen.</p>
				<h3>cards</h3>
				<p>To download and print the cards, visit <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OaxCVDs_NqL-5FiIuIbnxm7rjchocYE-" target="_blank">Flaggravation</a> on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dreamhatchergames" target="_blank">DreamHatcher Games</a>.</p>
				<h3>rules</h3>
				<p>
					<h4>setup</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Open the Flaggravation web app on a phone or tablet.
							<ul>
								<li>Enter the names of all players.</li>
								<li>Set a Flag Goal. For first-time players, the recommended goal is 5.</li>
								<li>Click "Continue". Place the device in a central spot close to all players.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Spread out all the component cards, face-down, in a messy Pool on the table.</li>
						<li>Each player selects a Hand of 5 random cards from the Pool.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>turn order</h4>
					<p>Play is simultaneous each round.</p>
					<h4>gameplay</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>All players select 1 card from their Hand to place face-down in front of them.
							<ul>
								<li>At any time, you may look at the cards in front of you.</li>
								<li>Make sure they don't get mixed up with the Pool.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Once all players have made a selection, all players pass the remaining 4 cards in their Hand to the left (clockwise).</li>
						<li>All players now pick up another random card from the Pool to add to their Hand. Play continues in this way throughout the game.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>special rules</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>At any point, if, in your face-down pile in front of you, you have all the components required for a Flag shown on the app, say the name of the Flag aloud.
							<ul>
								<li>Note that some cards are "Wild" cards, meaning they can represent any 1 of a set of components. (Ex: Colors substitutes for a Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Black, or White.)</li>
								<li>If 2 players are eligible (see below), it's whoever says the Flag name first.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Reveal these component cards to show they match the Flag's requirements.
							<ul>
								<li>If they do not, place these cards back in front of you, face-down.</li>
								<li>If they do meet the requirements:
									<ol>
										<li>Place these component cards back in the Pool, face-down, and mess the Pool around without looking so no one can tell which cards they are.</li>
										<li>Additionally, click on the applicable Flag on the app, then select your name. The app will keep track of how many Flags you have collected.</li>
										<li>The app also shows how many cards to collect for constructing the Flag. (The longer a Flag goes without being claimed, the more cards it's worth!) Select this quantity of random cards from the Pool to place face-down in front of you.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>end</h4>
					<p>The game ends when someone has claimed the Goal number of Flags; this player wins.</p>
