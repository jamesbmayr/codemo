				<h3>about</h3>
				<p>This is a vexillological drafting card game with a score-keeping web app.<br><br>Players collect components common to flags from all around the world - like colors, structures, and objects often featured on flags - and use these to claim flags shown on screen.</p>
				<h3>cards</h3>
				<p>To download and print the cards, visit <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OaxCVDs_NqL-5FiIuIbnxm7rjchocYE-" target="_blank">Flaggravation</a> on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dreamhatchergames" target="_blank">DreamHatcher Games</a>.</p>
				<h3>rules</h3>
				<p>
					<h4>setup</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Open the Flaggravation web app on a phone or tablet.
							<ul>
								<li>Enter the names of all players.</li>
								<li>Set a Flag Goal. For first-time players, the recommended goal is 5.</li>
								<li>Click "Continue". Place the device in a central spot close to all players.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Shuffle the component cards and place them in a face-down Draw Deck.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>turn order</h4>
					<p>Play is simultaneous each round.</p>
					<h4>gameplay</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>All players take cards from the Draw Deck to get to a Hand of 5 cards.</li>
						<li>All players place 1 Hand card face-up in front of them in a Personal Pile.</li>
						<li>After all players have made a selection and confirmed they're ready, all players pass the remaining cards in their Hand to the left (clockwise).</li>
						<li>Play continues in this way throughout the game.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>special rules</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>After placing your card, but before passing your Hand to the next player, you may claim a Flag by saying its name aloud. Your Personal Pile must contain the components required for the Flag, as shown on the app.
							<ul>
								<li>Some cards are "Wild" and represent any 1 of a set of components. (Ex: Colors substitutes for a Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Black, or White.)</li>
								<li>If 2 players have a valid claim, whoever said the Flag name first proceeds.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Consolidate the component cards to show they match the Flag's requirements:
							<ul>
								<li>Place these component cards in a face-up Discard Deck.</li>
								<li>In the app, next to the Flag, is a number of bonus cards (0, 1, or 2). Select this many cards from your Hand to place in your Personal Pile.</li>
								<li>In the app, select the Flag, and then your name, to increase your score.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>When the Draw Deck runs out, shuffle the Discard Deck to make a new one.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>end</h4>
					<p>The game ends when someone has claimed the Goal number of Flags; this player wins.</p>
