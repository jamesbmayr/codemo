				<h3>What is this?</h3>
				<p>Chance leads to choice. Options arise out of opportunities. Decisions determine destiny.<br><br>These slides depict a thought experiment: alternate timelines where my professional career happened a little differently. Think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure autobiography.</p>
				<h3>Which ones are real?</h3>
				<p>After the first few slides - my childhood and education - it branches out into nine intertwined lines. The real events are indicated in blue, while alternate timelines are depicted in red. Each of the alternates has a clear theme, a life I might have lived, and there are always options to move between those paths.</p>
				<h3>Why these paths?</h3>
				<p>At the time(line) of this project's creation, I'm a product manager at Mainstay - a communication and engagement platform for higher education institutions. So I focused on plausible paths that might have led me to where I am today, based on jobs and programs I actually applied for or considered at some point.<br><br>Perhaps in another timeline, I made it big as a rock band musician, or even published a novel or two. The choices I made and the chances I got open a multiverse of possibilities, only a handful of which are represented here. I encourage you to consider the roads you haven't traveled too!</p>
				<h3>Who took the photos?</h3>
				<p>All of these pictures are of me or were taken by me (with some notable exceptions courtesy of Liz Ford). Of course, since I didn't actually do a lot of this, some of these photos are not what they appear!</p>
